# Project-Eclipse
The main goal?: Player versus entity combat.

## Description
Have you ever been playing on a server, kind of bored? You try walking around, finding some mobs to fight. Then you kill a few mobs, try killing them without being hit, but it just doesn't challenge you too much? You start wondering: "What if minecraft PvE was fun?"
I might be projecting, but this is something that happens to me on a weekly basis. And I think it has to change. Therefore, this project shall receive the attention and love it deserves (hopefully).

If you want to feel like a clairvoyant and take a little peek into the future, I kindly refer you to planned_features.md, where all the planned features are explained thoroughly.
